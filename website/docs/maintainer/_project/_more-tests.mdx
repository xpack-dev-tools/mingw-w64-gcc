### Running the tests with the external binaries

It is possible to run the tests on a regular machine, using the system binaries.

Clone the project and the helper, and link them:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/mingw-w64-gcc-xpack.git/xpacks
mkdir -pv ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/mingw-w64-gcc-xpack.git/xpacks/@xpack-dev-tools
ln -sv ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper-xpack.git ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/mingw-w64-gcc-xpack.git/xpacks/@xpack-dev-tools/xbb-helper
```

To calibrate the tests with the system tools:

```sh
bash ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/mingw-w64-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/test.sh --system --develop
```

On Ubuntu, to install mingw-gcc, libraries and wine, use:

```sh
sudo apt-get install --yes g++-mingw-w64 mingw-w64-tools wine64
```

On Manjaro, install

```sh
sudo pacman --sync mingw-w64-gcc mingw-w64-tools wine
```

If the 32-bit libraries are not available, skip the tests:

```sh
bash ~/Work/xpack-dev-tools/mingw-w64-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/test.sh --system --skip-32
```
